   - ✅ Database storage with PostgreSQL
   - ✅ Incremental sync to avoid duplicates

2. **Workout Processing & Analysis**
   - ✅ File processing pipeline (.fit → .tcx → processed JSON)
   - ✅ TSS calculation for bike, run, and swim workouts
   - ✅ Workout type detection and categorization
   - ✅ Basic workout visualization with simple charts

3. **User Profile Management**
   - ✅ Athlete profile storage with training zones
   - ✅ Heart rate, power, and pace zones for all sports
   - ✅ Test date tracking (FTP, LTP, CSS tests)
   - ✅ Frontend profile editing interface

4. **Web Interface**
   - ✅ React frontend with sidebar navigation
   - ✅ Sync status and manual sync triggers
   - ✅ Profile viewing and editing
   - ✅ Weekly workout calendar view
   - ✅ Workout detail modal with data visualization

5. **Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Docker containerization
   - ✅ FastAPI backend with proper error handling
   - ✅ Database schema with proper relationships
   - ✅ Logging and exception handling

### Core Value Proposition
The app currently provides **data aggregation and basic analysis** - it's a "data hub" that collects training data from Garmin and presents it in a structured, accessible format with basic metrics (TSS).

- ❌ UI Agent (prepare data for frontend)

### 4. **Training Planning & Recommendations - COMPLETELY MISSING**
- ❌ Next week training suggestions
- ❌ Generic training type repository
- ❌ Macro cycle planning
- ❌ Workout recommendations based on current fitness/fatigue
- ❌ Training load balancing

### 5. **Advanced Features - MISSING**
- ❌ Multi-athlete support (coach view)

## Priority Recommendations for Adding Value

### **Phase 1: Immediate Value (1-2 weeks)**
**Goal: Provide actionable insights beyond data aggregation**

#### 1.1 **Implement PMC (Performance Management Chart)**
- **Impact**: High - This is the core value proposition for endurance athletes
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Add to services/metrics.py
  def calculate_ctl(workouts, days=42):
      # CTL = exponentially weighted average of TSS over 42 days
      
  def calculate_atl(workouts, days=7):
      # ATL = exponentially weighted average of TSS over 7 days
      
  def calculate_tsb(ctl, atl):
      # TSB = CTL - ATL
  ```
- **Frontend**: Add PMC chart component with CTL/ATL/TSB lines

#### 1.2 **Basic Recovery Analysis**
- **Impact**: High - Provides immediate actionable insights
- **Effort**: Low (1-2 days)
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Add to services/analysis.py
  def analyze_recovery_status(health_metrics, recent_workouts):
      # Combine HRV, sleep, RHR trends with recent TSS
      # Return: "train hard", "maintain", "rest"
  ```

#### 1.3 **Weekly Training Suggestions**
- **Impact**: High - Direct coaching value
- **Effort**: Medium (3-4 days)
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Add to services/planning.py
  def suggest_next_week_training(current_ctl, current_tsb, recent_workouts):
      # Based on current fitness and fatigue
      # Return: list of suggested workouts with TSS targets
  ```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Value (2-3 weeks)**
**Goal: Provide comprehensive coaching support**

#### 2.1 **Training Type Repository**
- **Impact**: Medium-High - Reusable training content
- **Effort**: Medium (1 week)
- **Implementation**:
  ```sql
  -- Add to database schema
  CREATE TABLE training_types (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT,
      sport TEXT,
      description TEXT,
      target_tss INTEGER,
      duration_min INTEGER,
      intensity_factor FLOAT,
      zones TEXT[],
      instructions TEXT
  );
  ```

#### 2.2 **Macro Cycle Planning**
- **Impact**: High - Long-term training structure
- **Effort**: High (2 weeks)
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Add to services/planning.py
  def plan_macro_cycle(target_race_date, current_fitness, target_fitness):
      # Create 12-16 week training plan
      # Include build, peak, taper phases
  ```

#### 2.3 **Advanced Health Analysis**
- **Impact**: Medium - Better recovery insights
- **Effort**: Medium (1 week)
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Add to services/analysis.py
  def analyze_health_trends(health_metrics, days=30):
      # Trend analysis for sleep, HRV, RHR
      # Anomaly detection
      # Correlation with training load
  ```

### **Phase 3: Agent Enhancement (1-2 weeks)**

  ```python
  # Add to agents/analysis_agent.py
  class AnalysisAgent:
      def analyze_training_patterns(self, workouts, health_data):
          # Use LLM to identify patterns, suggest improvements
          
      def generate_recommendations(self, current_status):
          # Personalized training recommendations
